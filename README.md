Codes, scripts and data for nucleosynthesis Hands-on at SNP CNS SS 2024


# System Pre-request

Students who want to actively participate in the hands-on activity should prepare several tools on their own laptops.

<ins>for Linux users</ins>

The hands-on activity will be based on Linux Sytem (confirmed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS).

1. Ubuntu System (Linux) -> see the following notes for Mac/Windows Users
2. git (to get this repository)
3. intel MKL (including intel oneAPI) to run the code
4. any text editors (vi, emacs, etc.)
5. gnuplot (for plotting): Sample plot scripts are prepared, but is is not necessary is you can use other plotter.

<ins>for Mac users</ins>

macOS is a Unix system, so users can prepare the requested tools listed above (for Linux users). MacPorts, Homebrew, and other distributed macOS binaries are available. Executable code for macOS is included in this repository.

Similar to Windows users, virtual environments can also be useful. However, recent macOS systems with Apple silicon (ARM architecture) may cause several issues

<ins>for Windows users</ins>

Unfortunately, there is no support for native Windows systems. If you are an expert, it may be worth developing an environment using WSL. However, I recommend developing on an Ubuntu system in a virtual environment.

- VMWare
- VirtualBox

(I will add further support information on Virtual environments.)
